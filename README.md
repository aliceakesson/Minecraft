# Minecraft
My senior exam project in which I attempt to code Minecraft with Unity in the span of ~6 months

I've come to the conclusion that I won't be able to publish it all unless I fix Git lFS (please someone help me..). anyways here's some screnshots and info

Game includes: 
- Basic moving mechanics (walk, crouch, sprint, jump)
- Different camera perspective
- Pigs <3
- Creepers & zombies 
- Plains
- Desert
- Ability to place and destroy blocks 
- Ability to eat 
- Music (only Sweden (the song Sweden) though) and sound effects 
- Randomly generated terrain with perlin noise 
- Light changes throughout the day
