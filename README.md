Game includes: 
- Basic moving mechanics (walk, crouch, sprint, jump)
- Different camera perspective
- Pigs <3
- Creepers & zombies 
- Plains
- Desert
- Ability to place and destroy blocks 
- Ability to eat 
- Music (only Sweden (the song Sweden) though) and sound effects 
- Randomly generated terrain with perlin noise 
- Light changes throughout the day
